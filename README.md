# Nipped
The Nipped folder has everything you need to play, but if you'd like to look into the code, in src/mellasonic/Nipped, you can run Driver.java to play the game.
Do note the game requires javafx to be set up in your IDE if you are running the .java, but JRE is bundled with the .exe, meaning that JavaFX does not need to be set up for the .exe,
nor do you need any specific version of java.
